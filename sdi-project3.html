<p>Ramadan is a month on the lunar calendar in which muslims fast each day of the month from dawn till dusk. Fasting the month of Ramadan is required from all Muslims who have reached the age of puberty to learn and to feel what the poor and needy feel. This is also the reason why charity to the poor is a must from Muslims. I chose this theme because it represents who I am as a person as well as my religion which is often misunderstood.</p>
<p>In my story, I mention prayer many times, this is because a Muslim is required to pray five times a day, during specific times. In other words, these five times are "appointments" in which we have with God, and we must make sure to pray on time. There are many more prayers than just five times a day, but these five prayers are a must to all Muslims.</p>
